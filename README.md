# X'mas Game

This is my first project from the Ironhack coding bootcamp. It is a christmas themed run-and-jump game.


The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript syntax and Object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Get Started
You can use the code editor of your choice. I personally use Visual Studio Code.

### Installation
Since there are preloaded image and sound files in the project, a local server is needed to run the html file.


If you use Visual Studio Code, there is an extention called [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) which does the setup of the local server for you.


Alternatively, you can set up the local server according to the [instruction from p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)
